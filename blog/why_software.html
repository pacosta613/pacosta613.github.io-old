<p>Why did I decide to learn software development?</p>

<p>I started out at a young age always disassemblying and reassembly computers, labtops, and game systems. My passion for technology actually started with hardware side of technology. It was always fun openining up xbox 360s, PSP, playstation 2 and 3. I definitely felt at some point in the future I should continue to pursue maybe not a career but at least a hobby on hardware technology.</p>

<p>After graduating from college with a Bachelors degree, I found myself in a oppressing career that started to make me second guess what I wanted to do with my career. So I went back to school and decided to major in computer engineering. During that semester, I built a digital trainer, built out sketches for some models, and discover code. I saw some students writing code with duel monitors and could see the passion they had in their eyes. It was awesome!</p>

<p>So I decided to do more research on coding. I came across a couple of coding bootcamps and read many mix reviews. I wanted to find something that will challenge me, help me learn, and also find a career. I came across Flatiron’s web development online course with a friend and we decided to jump on this wonderful opportunity. Software development is of the best things I’ve invested my life in. Learning how to code really has help discipline me in a different perspective. I’ve learned to be patient and selective in handling certain challeneges in life. I’m having a lot of fun and ready to spend the rest of my life learning software technologies.</p>

<p>Learn, Love, Code.</p>
