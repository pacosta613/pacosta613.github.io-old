What is HTML and CSS?

HTML and CSS are both considered front-end development. What front-end development is everything the user sees. This is known as client-side programming which is what the user actually sees. For example, front-end development consists of things like fonts, drop-down menus, buttons, transitions, sliders, contact forms, etc. Now having the basic understanding of Front-end Development, I can explain to you HTML and CSS.

HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the language use to structure yourwebsite along with all the contents in it. It consists of short code short codes typed into a text-file by the user. HTML tells the web browser how to display the content and images to the user. The tools in HTML are called tags. Tags are tools in HTML that allows the user to add images, videos and audio clips.

CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a HTML. It allows you to specify things like the font you want on your page, the size of your text, whether the page is to have 2 columns, whether your text is to be in bold or italics, and so on. It pretty much gives you the power to control how your the appearance of your website. It goes hand to hand with HTML.
